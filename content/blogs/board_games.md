For those who know me well, they are aware of my introspective personality. I hardly ever start shit-talking to someone I don't know (or even to those I know) and I am a much better listener than a speaker. Meeting new people and making new friends is sometimes challenging, and most of the good ones that I have today I met in some context where we could get to know each other through a common interest: friends who played handball with me in Highschool, friends who worked on the same extracurricular project in undergrad, friends who where my flatmates and so on. More recently, I found an amazing community among people who like to play board games and I made some very good friends from that.

I always liked to play cards and board games, encouraged by my parents and family since I was very young. I was always down to play Tranca (a Brazilian card game) with my family during holidays, and I was always asking for the newest version of Risk for Christmas. During all the period I lived with my parents, I would play with them or invite some friends over for playing once in a while.

I confess that, during undergrad, I got overwhelmed by everything that is going on: parties, projects, living by myself... On top of that, in Brazil there is still a stigma that board games are for children and weirdos. My board games started gathering some dust, since I had neither time nor whom to play with. Video games started taking over instead. It was easier to acquire and maintain, I didn't need anybody to play with and the variety was absurd. However, I did not know why by the time, but it was missing something.

When I started working, things started to change. I met a group of very likeminded people at work, who also like to play board games. The topic took a while to appear, but when someone finally brought it, we could connect to each other very quickly. So we started to meet regularly and playing a vast variety of board games, most of them that I had never heard before.

A couple years after the pandemic came, and the board game community got stronger in Brazil. People were locked at home, and they realized it was a very good way to entertain while socializing with other people living under the same shelter. For me, it was not different: my board game collection grew massively. Every other week, a new board game was delivered at home, and I couldn't wait to learn it and play it with my parents and sister (I spent 8 months with them while I was working fully remotely).

Here at LBS, I am engaged with the Board Game Club, of which I just became one of the co-presidents. It is amazing to get together with other students every other week, to meet them and have some fun while playing.

For me, Board Games are not only an entertainment. I look at them as a social tool. You get to know people while playing and to connect with them. It may be because of the theme or because of the story of that specific play, it doesn't matter. What matter is that people in that community is very friendly and open-minded. 

Last but not least, it is an amazing learning tool as well. Different games use different mechanics and require different skills. Also, they are based in different themes. So you can learn how to think strategically, long-term planing, trade-offs, trading, politics and history, to name a few. And all of that while having some laughts and making friends, simply amazing!
