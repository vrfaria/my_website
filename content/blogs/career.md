title: My Career So Far
---

I was decided to study Engineering since I can remember starting thinking about going to university. My curiosity to learn and understand how and why things work the way they work, my affinity with numbers and physics and a passion for Motorsport all contributed to my choice of studying Mechanical Engineering. Nevertheless, besides my internship, I never had a professional experience on the field.

Since I graduated at the end of 2017, I have worked at Gradus, a Brazilian boutique management consulting firm. In 4.5 years working there before coming to LBS for my MBA, I had many challenging projects in many different industries and I found the underlying motivation in doing what I do.

All started with a organizational restructuring project in a big beverage company. To be honest, it was very different from everything I have seem in university. I had no need of those fancy differential equation that I learnt to solve, or even "basic" calculus. All I was doing was using basic formulas in Excel and building PowerPoint presentations to share insights with the clients. It was not the most challenging task, but I was still learning a lot about the client's business. 

Things started to get better from my second project. It was my second project with the same partner, this time working with a pet food manufacturer. The partner had noticed during the first project we worked together that I was starving for more challenging analytical tasks, and she assigned me some. In one of them, I had to come with a full model to predict how much time and how often each PoS should be visited by a vendor and then assign each of those PoS to a vendor to visit, respecting their maximal workload and minimizing the time they spent in traffic moving from one PoS to another.

This was my first adventure using Alteryx Designer, which I had to learn mostly from scratch by myself. It was a brand new tool that the office had purchased a few licences for us to explore, and it proof itself very useful for us. A few months later, after replicating the same analysis in the context of two other clients, I received the Analytics Excellence Award from Alteryx in their Inspire conference in London, in October 2019.

Since then, the partners started steering me towards similar tasks, and I was getting more and more excited by the data and analytics world. I was getting a lot of motivation from developing such models and finding amazing insights for our clients, improving their performance both financially and operationally, including in ESG terms.

More recently, before coming to LBS, the partners invited me to be the company's Head of Analytics, starting a new Business Unit dedicated to creating Data & Analytics solutions to improve companies' productivity, leading a team with 3 Data Analysts. In the 9 months preceding my MBA's start, I conduced the Analytics BU business plan and pipeline of activities & projects, defining priorities and resources allocation, I managed the interface and communication with Consulting, Developers and Products teams, as well as with Gradus' partners, I provided 20+ analytical tools in the cloud to support consulting projects by increasing consultants' productivity and analysis' reliability, sophistication and replicability and I led the development of 2 analytical products designed to plan, manage and optimize workforce allocation.

After my MBA, I will be joining them back to continue this journey, for which I am completely excited!
