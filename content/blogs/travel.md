Travelling is one of my favourite activities in life, no matter the reason behind it. I believe that it grew in me since I was a child and I got used to get in the car with my parents and sister and travel for long hours to visit my grandparents, go to the beach or any other destination. It was frequent to spend 6h to 13h on the road. Some trips, though, can be seen as some milestones, as I will share with you next.

For example, the first time I took an airplane it was in 2006 and I was 13 years old. My grandparents invited all the family to go there for a week on a resort: their 3 daughters (including my mother) and 1 son with their partners and their 7 (at the time) grandchildren. It was a wonderful experience and I could never imagine I would lose count of how many other flights I would take.

In 2009, I had my first international experience. My parents, my sister and I went to Foz do Iguacu for holidays. From there, we crossed the border to Paraguay in one day to buy some (very) cheap stuff that I can't really recall what it was. Another day, we crossed the border to Argentina, where we had some amazing food: olives, dried fruits and parilla, more precisely.

The first time I came to Europe it was 2014. I had been approved for a Double Degree program at Ã‰cole Centrale Paris and moved to Paris for a 2-year exchange program. From there, in that period, I explored 22 countries and over 80 cities, travelling both with friends and by myself. More recently, I have been for the first time to North America (Orlando, in February 2022) and to Africa, when I went to Morocco in February this year.

I hope this is just the beginning of my journey. What fascinates me the most about travelling is being able to exchange experiences with people with different cultures and realities, growing a human being while learning to have empathy. The food, the language, the landmarks, they all are relevant pieces when traveling, and when put together, they allow me to have a deeper understanding of a culture. It is simply fascinating!
