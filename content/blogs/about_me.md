Born in Lavras, Minas Gerais, in Brazil, I have been moving around the country (and later the world) since I was a kid. My parents didn't settle in a single city until I was 10 years old, and once I completed 17 I left home to pursue my dreams. Nevertheless, I am still very close to all my family, and thanks to technology I am able to keep in touch with them even from the other side of the Atlantic.

London is the 10th different city I have lived in before completing 30 years, and the UK the 3rd different country. Even though moving is not a novelty at this stage, it always come with new surprises and experiences, both attended and unexpected. Right now, I am about to finish the first year of my MBA program at LBS, and if, at the one hand, I have plenty of stories to tell about my first year, on the other hand I can't wait for what is coming next!

In this blog, I want to share with you a little bit about myself and tell you some of the things that motivate me. So please stay tuned in if you want to hear about traveling, board games, management consulting and data science.

Welcome on-board!
