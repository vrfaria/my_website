title: Data Science for Business at LBS
---

I enrolled in the Data Science for Business course to enhance my Data Science skills, keeping in mind my plans after the MBA as I explained in the previous session. I learnt a lot o data science best practices, models and applications while working with them in my consulting projects, but I lacked any hard-coding background, and the course could fill this gap.

The logic behind all the tasks we performed remains very similar. That said, the main challenge was about the syntax to use while coding: What function to call? How to configure this object? What are the different configuration parameters I can use?

Being 100% transparent, ChatGPT has been a good ally. Whenever I got stuck for many minutes or I got a syntax error that I could not figure out how to correct, I would ask it how to proceed, and I would usually get useful results.

Learning how to code is about practicing, so it required a lot of effort to complete all the weekly workshops. However, coordinate it with other MBA obligations was not easy, and I have the feeling that I could have had a better learning experience had I had the time to go deeper into the problem sets. That said, I imagine the course could work better in a modular format, where you have two classes the same day every other week, giving the students more time to complete the assignments.

All in all, it was great to explore the functionalities that R has to offer. Even though all the data manipulation at the beginning may be a little bit slow paced and could have been replaced for deeper understanding of machine learning models, learning how to scrape data and access databases is certainly useful for my future work.
